# Tic Tac Toe Game with AI

This project is a **Tic Tac Toe Game** that allows you to play against an AI opponent. The AI uses the minimax algorithm to make optimal moves, creating a challenging experience for the player. The game includes a graphical interface where players can choose their side (X or O) and see the game progress.

### Key Features

- **AI Opponent**: The AI is programmed to use the minimax algorithm to make optimal moves and challenge the player.
- **Graphical Interface**: A simple Pygame-based GUI displays the Tic Tac Toe board, allows player interactions, and shows the AI's moves.
- **Restart Option**: After each game, players can click the "Restart" button to reset the board and play again.
